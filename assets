Phase	Hours (with buffer)	Notes
Analysis	32	High buffer suggests significant unknowns in BRD clarity, logic mapping, or SQL complexity.
Development	40	Covers SQL, extract creation, NAS placement, SFTP, Airflow orchestration, and coordination overhead.
UAT/Deployment	16	Ample for multiple UAT cycles, stakeholder sign-off, Prod prep, and testing.
Prod Support	20	Good safety margin for post-deployment monitoring, bug fixes, or stakeholder follow-up.
