Task: Take 20 CDO objects and 10 SV objects from the Teradata OSS_PROVSIONING_V database in OSS and identify how that object would be renamed if the same object lived in the MAA Databricks Platform.



OSS (Teradata) Connections strings:
DEV/QA/INT/UAT -> AWSTDPVS.SYS.CIGNA.COM
PROD -> AWSTDPRD1.SYS.CIGNA.COM

Table Naming Conventions
Below is the third draft of the MAA Databricks Platform naming conventions as of 05/30/2024. Please note that these standards and best practices are subject to change as requirements evolve based on stakeholder feedback.

Data Being Replicated from OSS
For data originally sourced from OSS, please follow the below naming conventions in lower case:

<database_name_with_'_v'_removed>_<table_name>
OSS Example for data originally sourced from BUSINESS_OPS_CORE_DEV2_V.EXT_SALES_CHANNEL_PROJ_MIX (DEV): business_ops_core_dev2_ext_sales_channel_proj_mix
OSS Example for data originally sourced from REPORTING_INT_V.SDO_MILL_REPRC_CLM_MED (TEST): reporting_int_sdo_mill_reprc_clm_med
OSS Example for data originally sourced from OSS_EXPORT_V.CDO_MED_CLM_DTL (PROD): oss_export_cdo_med_clm_dtl
All Other Data
For all other data, please follow the below naming conventions:

For maa_{domain}_rawz and maa_{domain}_rawz_v, as well as maa_{domain}_cnfz and maa_{domain}_cnfz_v: <domain>_<entity>
Examples:
clm_med_dtl
clm_phrm
auth_admsn_hdr
clncl_grv
mbr_demg
fncl_bal_aud
For maa_{domain}_pubz and maa_{domain}_pubz_v: <domain>_<entity>_<time window>
Examples:
clm_enrlmt_monthly
sales_agt_hier (no suffix for current data)
prov_hier_history
fncl_revnu_pharm_yearly
fncl_revnu_med_quarterly
mbr_condn (no suffix for current data)
Backups and Snapshots: For all backups and snapshots, simply add the suffix "_bkp" for backups and "_snpsht" for snapshots, followed by the date of the backup/snapshot in yyyymmdd format (Example: fncl__cost_current_bkp_20240326)

Delta Live Tables: When utilizing Delta live tables, simply add the "_dlt" suffix to your table names to denote it is part of a DLT Pipeline (Example: fncl_cost_current_dlt)

DBT: When utilizing DBT for your workflow, please use the below prefixes based on your model stage:

maa_{domain}_rawz / maa_{domain}_rawz_v → "stg_" (Example: stg_fncl_cost)
maa_{domain}_cnfz / maa_{domain}_cnfz_v → "int_" (Example: int_fncl_cost)
maa_{domain}_pubz / maa_{domain}_pubz_v → "mart_" / "dim_" / "fct_" / "agg_" (whichever makes more sense for your use case) (Example: mart_fncl_cost_daily)
