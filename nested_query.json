**1. Analysis of existing AAH and listing out the columns that we use for SGD reporting**

* AAH data is derived through multiple stages: `AHier`, `AHier_PDCR_BY_AFF_DT`, and `AHier_PDCR_BY_END_DT`.
* These are further transformed into `BHier` and finally `CHier`, which is the core output used in downstream reporting.
* The `CHier` table contains fields used in SGD reporting such as:

  * AGENT\_ID
  * AGENT\_PDCR\_CD
  * SIRCON\_AGENT\_ID
  * AGENT\_NAME
  * AGENT\_LEVEL
  * AGENT\_EFFECTIVE\_DATE
  * AGREEMENT\_EFFECTIVE\_DATE
  * AGREEMENT\_END\_DATE
  * Role and metadata fields for each tier: PBE, GA, MGA, SGA, SGA2, FMO, RFMO, NFMO, AFMO
* These columns are likely loaded into GR\_MEMBER and Submitted Apps.
* Coordinate with data modelers and sprinters to ensure these columns (especially Agent NPN and tier hierarchy) are supported in the new system (EVOLVE).

**2. Identify impacted code and steps to enhance**

**Impacted tables:**

* temp\_BROKER\_SIRCON\_AGENT
* AHier
* AHier\_PDCR\_BY\_AFF\_DT
* AHier\_PDCR\_BY\_END\_DT
* BHier
* CHier
* EEChan, EEChan2, DerChan
* REPORTING\_T.LU\_TOPLINE\_CHANNEL

**Impacted procedures:**

* PROC\_FOR\_AGENT\_AGREEMENT\_HISTORY
* Any ETL procedures or views that consume data from CHier or BHier

**Steps to enhance:**

* Refactor logic in the stored procedure and downstream processes to align with EVOLVE data model.
* Ensure all downstream processes are modified to consume the new hierarchy structure and identifiers.

**3. Impact of moving away from SIRCON agent identifiers to Agent NPN (National Producer Number) from new system (EVOLVE)**

**Where SIRCON\_AGENT\_ID is currently used:**

* It is used throughout the procedure in tables: temp\_BROKER\_SIRCON\_AGENT, AHier, BHier, CHier
* Used in joins between hierarchy levels and as the key to identify agents
* Referenced in downstream matching logic such as MBR\_SALES\_AGT\_DIM in datamart\_member\_v

**Steps required:**

* Replace all joins on SIRCON\_AGENT\_ID with joins on Agent\_NPN
* Ensure Agent\_NPN is selected and propagated in all intermediary and final output tables like BHier and CHier
* Modify CHier output schema to expose Agent\_NPN as the external-facing identifier
* Verify all procedures, reports, and datamarts that use SIRCON\_AGENT\_ID and update accordingly

**Examples of required changes:**

* In joins like:
  `join MBR_SALES_AGT_DIM on agent.SIRCON_AGENT_ID = ...`
  change to:
  `join MBR_SALES_AGT_DIM on agent.Agent_NPN = ...`

**List of impacted procedures:**

* PROC\_FOR\_AGENT\_AGREEMENT\_HISTORY
* Any procedure/view that joins AAH data with external dimensions using SIRCON\_AGENT\_ID

**Changes to be done:**

* Refactor joins, selections, and groupings to use Agent\_NPN
* Update data contracts for downstream consumers (GR\_MEMBER, datamart\_member\_v, Submitted Apps)
* Validate test coverage for all code paths that previously used SIRCON\_AGENT\_ID
