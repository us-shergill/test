Here’s a breakdown of the work into **user stories for a biweekly sprint**, considering that **S3 versioning might already be in place**. The goal is to prioritize tasks that can be completed within one sprint while ensuring meaningful progress toward the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan.

---

### **Sprint Goal:**  
_“Establish a foundational Disaster Recovery strategy by assessing current infrastructure, automating critical backup processes, and enhancing access controls.”_

---

### **Story 1: Assess Current State and Define Recovery Objectives**  
- **Description:** Review the current Databricks-S3 setup and define recovery objectives.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Review existing DR practices (if any)  
  - [ ] Define RTO and RPO for critical workloads  
  - [ ] Identify critical data in S3 (catalog data, Delta tables, metadata)  
  - [ ] Document key service dependencies (IAM roles, networking)  
- **Estimated Effort:** 3 Story Points  

---

### **Story 2: Verify and Document Existing S3 Versioning**  
- **Description:** Since versioning might already exist, verify its configuration and ensure lifecycle policies are optimized.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Audit current S3 versioning setup  
  - [ ] Review lifecycle policies for cost optimization  
  - [ ] Document versioning status and gaps (if any)  
- **Estimated Effort:** 2 Story Points  

---

### **Story 3: Implement Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**  
- **Description:** Set up CRR for critical S3 buckets to a secondary AWS region for redundancy.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Identify critical buckets for replication  
  - [ ] Configure CRR (preferably using a separate AWS account for destination)  
  - [ ] Validate replication with test data  
- **Estimated Effort:** 5 Story Points  

---

### **Story 4: Automate Backups for S3 Using AWS Backup**  
- **Description:** Automate backups for S3 buckets to enhance data durability.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Configure AWS Backup for selected S3 buckets  
  - [ ] Define backup schedules and retention policies  
  - [ ] Test automated backups and validate data recovery  
- **Estimated Effort:** 5 Story Points  

---

### **Story 5: Implement Access Controls for S3 and Databricks**  
- **Description:** Strengthen data protection through IAM policies and Databricks access controls.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Review current IAM policies for S3  
  - [ ] Apply least privilege principles where needed  
  - [ ] Configure Databricks access controls to restrict data modifications  
- **Estimated Effort:** 3 Story Points  

---

### **Story 6: Design Basic Disaster Recovery (DR) Playbooks**  
- **Description:** Create initial recovery procedures for data deletion and Databricks workspace recovery.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Draft recovery steps for S3 data deletion using versioning  
  - [ ] Outline recovery steps for Databricks workspace failures  
  - [ ] Identify any automation gaps  
- **Estimated Effort:** 3 Story Points  

---

### **Story 7: Automate S3 Data Recovery Using AWS Lambda**  
- **Description:** Automate data recovery for S3 using Lambda functions.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Develop Lambda functions for object restoration  
  - [ ] Test Lambda recovery in a controlled environment  
  - [ ] Document the automation process  
- **Estimated Effort:** 5 Story Points  

---

### **Story 8: DR Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**  
- **Description:** Create DR documentation and conduct a knowledge-sharing session with the team.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - [ ] Document current DR configurations and playbooks  
  - [ ] Organize a session to discuss DR objectives and processes  
- **Estimated Effort:** 2 Story Points  

---

### **Sprint Summary:**
- **Total Estimated Story Points:** ~28  
- **Focus Areas:** Assessment, Automation, Backup Configuration, Access Control, Documentation  
- **Dependencies:** Coordination with the infrastructure and security teams
